## Hello! I'm Enzo 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at **Cornell University** with a strong interest in
**software engineering, product development, and data-driven systems**.
I enjoy building things end-to-end — from backend infrastructure to user-facing features —
with a focus on clarity, impact, and scalability.

Previously, I’ve worked across **SWE, Product, and Analytics** roles through
student orgs, internships, and independent projects.
